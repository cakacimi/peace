welcome programers to your first PEACE OF MIND APP challenge
Today we will be creating a side scroll game like flappy bird and sf cave
WHAT you will need
--> a character (can be a line ellipse or anything you wish)
--> a background (in a sidescroll game, the background moves)
//if you are unsure how to do this, refer to khan academy
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations/programming-scenes/a/animated-scenes//
--> the character to be able to move up and down via keyword commmands
--> that is it for now!!!
HAPPY CODING Y'ALL
